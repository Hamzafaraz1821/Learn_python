# floor division

# Python has great out-of-the-box support for mathematical operations. This, among other reasons, is why it has had such success in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science applications.

# Floor division is like normal division except the result is floored afterward, which means the result is rounded down to the nearest integer. The // operator is used for floor division.

# For example:

print(10 // 3)  # 3
print(10 // 5)  # 2

# exponents 

print(3 ** 2) # 9
print(2 ** 5) # 32

# increment and decrement called plus equals and minus equals

star_rating = 4
star_rating += 1
print(star_rating) # 5

star_rating -= 1
print(star_rating) # 4

star_rating  *= 2
print(star_rating) # 8

star_rating /= 2 #4.0, as a float
print(star_rating)

# scientific notation

print(16e3) # 16000.0

print(16e-3) # 0.016

Underscores for readability
Python also allows you to represent large numbers in the decimal format using underscores as the delimiter instead of commas to make it easier to read.

num = 16_000
print(num)
# Prints 16000

num = 16_000_000
print(num)
# Prints 16000000
# 
#"""

num = 16_000

print(num) # 16000
